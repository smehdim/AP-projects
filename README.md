This repository contains my assignments from an advanced programming course I took in the spring semester of 2021.

The first few assignments focused on becoming fluent in C++ and getting to know ideas such as backtracking.
As the semester progressed, the course delved deeper into object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.
